# tech-bus
A small application for Google Glass that keeps track of the Georgia Tech buses.

To build, you will need (probably):

1. cordova
2. bower
3. Android SDK
4. Glass SDK (GDK)

Then execute the following (probably):

1. bower update (or install, I forget)
2. cordova android (after plugging in your device)

This won't work too well on iOS.
